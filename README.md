## Welcome to Sammy's Capstone Corner! 

Hey there, web development enthusiasts!  This is where all the cool stuff I build lives. Buckle up, because we're about to embark on a journey through my web app capstone projects! 

Think of this as my personal playground for learning and experimenting. Each project is a stepping stone on my path to becoming a web development ninja.   So, whether you're a seasoned coder or just starting out, feel free to peek around and see if anything catches your eye. 

Here's a quick rundown of the adventures we have in store:

* **Capstone 1 - HTML Portfolio:**  This is where it all began! Dive into the world of HTML with a simple but awesome portfolio showcasing my skills (check it out live: [Capstone 1 - HTML Portfolio](https://sammyhub.me/web-app-capstones/Capstone%201%20-%20HTML%20Portfolio)). 

**Stay tuned!** More capstones will be popping up here as I level up my skills. 

**Speaking of leveling up,** if you have any feedback, suggestions, or just want to chat about web development, hit me up! I'm always happy to connect with fellow coding enthusiasts.  

**P.S.**  I'm using this fancy "README" file to keep track of everything. Consider it a roadmap for my web app capstone journey. Ô∏è
